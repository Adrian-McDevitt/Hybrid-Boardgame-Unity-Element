# Hybrid-Boardgame-Unity-Element
An interface I made for the hybrid board game that I and Austin Dahmm made for I_M 288
Note: This was my first time using Unity, and I did not know much about how to properly keep screen sizes consistent for the interface.
I say this because the end game button may be cut off from the screen, and every time I try to open this project, it says it does not exist.
Some code is not used in the final implementation, but I felt it fine to include just to show the process of what went down during the
creation of the interface and the game.
